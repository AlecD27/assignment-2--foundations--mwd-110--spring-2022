      <p>
        I'm very versitile when it comes to what I'm interested,
        but I have a lot of favorite things. My favorite animal is a dragonfly,
        my favorite food is chicken parmesan, my favorite music artist is grandson,
        and my favorite movie is Red Notice. One thing that means a lot to me, though,
        is dancing. Dancing is a huge passion of mine, and without it, I just wouldn't
        be the same.
